Within are the LaTeX files for my GCSE maths compilation, dubbed Tribulations.
I did not come up with most of the questions, the origins of which are vaguely outlined at the end of the pdf.
It's not meant to be a resource for students trying to learn GCSE, I made it as a resource to tutors who are working 1 to 1 with a student, as the questions are way too hard for a student to do by themselves.
